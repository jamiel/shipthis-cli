# Create the game in google play

You will need to manually create an app in Google Play. This will involve entering the name, agreeing to Google Play's TOS and uploading an initial build.

Broadly, the steps are:

1. Log into the **Google Play Console** with your Google account. [https://play.google.com/console](https://play.google.com/console)
1. Create a developer account and payments profile if prompted.
1. Click **"Create app"** on the Console dashboard.
1. Enter the app name, default language, and accept terms.
1. Go to **"Internal testing"** and create a new release.
1. Upload the initial build **AAB file** of your game from the previous step

To download the AAB file from the previous step, please run:

```bash
