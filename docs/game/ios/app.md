# Topic: `game ios app`

Commands in the `game ios app` topic are prefixed `shipthis game ios app`. They relate to the App Store App and BundleId for a specific game (generally in the currently directory).

:::info
An **App Store App** is the public-facing application available in the App Store. It includes metadata like descriptions, screenshots, and submission details, representing the final product users download.

A **Bundle ID** is a unique identifier for your app within Appleâ€™s ecosystem. It connects your app to services, certificates, and provisioning profiles, ensuring it can be built, run, and managed correctly.

**You can view the registered Bundle IDs (Identifiers) and their associated capabilities in the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list).**

:::

:::tip
You will need to be authenticated against ShipThis and Apple before you can use
these commands. To do that please run the following commands first:

- [`shipthis login`](/docs/reference/login)
- [`shipthis apple login`](/docs/reference/apple/login)

## Commands

### `game ios app create`

#### Description

Creates an App and BundleId in the Apple Developer Portal. This command is run
as part of the [`shipthis game wizard`](/docs/reference/game/wizard) command.

When run, this command will register a new App Store App and BundleId using the App
Store Connect API. It will ask you to confirm the name of the App and the BundleId
string which is typically in the form of `com.mycompany.mygame`. Both of these need
to be unique within the Apple ecosystem. ShipThis will suggest values for these.

 you should run the `shipthis game ios app sync` command.

to enable in the Apple Developer Portal.

Currently, only the following permissions are supported:

- **Access WiFi**
- **Push Notifications**

:::warning

If your game uses other capabilities or if you are using plugins to enable certain
features such as **GPS** or **file access**, please get in touch so that we can work with you.

**ShipThis is still in beta and we need your help to improve it.**
