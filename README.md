## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

### What you'll need

- A Godot 3.6 or 4.X game
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above
- **If you are building an iOS game** - an [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com)
- **If you are building an Android game** - a [Play Console developer account](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup)

### 1. Install ShipThis

ShipThis can be installed as a package via the [NPM package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/). Run the following at the command line:

```bash
npm install -g shipthis
```

### 2. Create an account

Set up an account with ShipThis by logging in for the first time using the [`shipthis login`](https://shipthis.cc/docs/reference/login) command.

```bash
shipthis login
```

### 3. Set up your game

Next, run the [wizard command](https://shipthis.cc/docs/reference/game/wizard) to configure your game on ShipThis. The command takes a platform parameter - this can be either **android** or **ios**. Run this command from within a Godot game directory (with a **project.godot** file):

### Set up an Android game

```bash
shipthis game wizard android
```

### Set up an iOS game

```bash
shipthis game wizard ios
```

### 4. Ship

Now you can publish new versions your game to TestFlight or Google Play with the [`shipthis game ship`](https://shipthis.cc/docs/reference/game/ship) command:

```bash
